# TrueLearn-demo

This web app is intended to showcase the flexibility of the `truelearn.utils.visualisations` package and provide an example of how TrueLearn can be integrated into online learning platforms. The app relies on React for the frontend and Flask for the backend.

In order for the app to function as intended, both the backend and frontend must be running at the same time.

## Running the backend

To start the server:
1. Move into the backend directory
  
        cd backend
  
2. Install the dependencies

        pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Flask server

        python main.py

The default server address is [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Running the frontend

To run the frontend client:
1. Move into the frontend directory
  
        cd frontend

2. Install the dependencies

        npm install

3. Run the client

        npm start

The client will then be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
